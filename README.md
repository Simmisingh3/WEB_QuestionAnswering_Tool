# Steps to run this file
1) Copy and extract this file from github

2) After opening the file, On terminal(Command prompt) activate the virtual environment - backend\venv\Scripts\activate

3) Change the directory(On terminal) - cd backend

3) On terminal, Install requirements - pip install -r requirements.txt

4) On terminal - uvicorn main:app --reload

5) Address - http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

6) a) On the urls Post section, type the URL

exmaple - 

{
  "urls": [
    "https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index"
  ]
}
b) On the ask question Post section , type the questions

{
  "question": "What is machine learning?"
}

Output from the above question - 

{
  "answer": "Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and models that allow computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed."
}

Example of some famous URLs to Ingest:

Scikit-Learn - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html
